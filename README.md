# Instahyre (Clone) 🌐
**Instahyre** is an advanced hiring platform based on artificial intelligence, enabling recruiters to hire top talent effortlessly. ... If you are looking for jobs, Instahyre connects you with curated opportunities based on your profile. No fake jobs, mass emails or spam like you're used to on other platforms. 

In this project we have tried to make a clone of Instahyre. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.

# Technology Stack Used 💻
In this project we have used the following tech stack.

- HTML: For creating layout
